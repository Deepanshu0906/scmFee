This repository contains our front-end project **Travel India**, developed as part of our coursework. It is our **first-year mini project**, and we have uploaded it here as part of the subject **Source Code Management (SCM)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
**Travel India** is a static website designed to help users explore travel destinations across India. It includes multiple pages such as:
- Homepage  
- Login Page  
- Booking Page  
- About Us Page  
- Destination Page  
- Services Page

The project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is fully responsive and user-friendly, with a clean layout and smooth navigation.

## 📁 Repository Contents
This repository includes:
- All HTML files for the individual pages  
- CSS files for styling and responsive design

## 🤝 Team Effort
This website was created by a team of three members as part of our learning experience. All members contributed to different parts of the website, and we collaborated using GitHub to manage our source code, track changes, and stay updated with each other's work.
